                        Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered gameboard with 64
                        squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The game is played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is
                        believed to have originated in India sometime before the 7th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Play does not involve hidden information. Each player begins with 16 pieces. Each of the six
                        piece types moves differently, with the most powerful being the queen and the least powerful the
                        pawn. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king by placing it under an inescapable
                        threat of capture. To this end, a player's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent's
                        pieces, while supporting each other.

                        Chess is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8)
                        and eight columns (called files and denoted with letters a to h) of squares. The colors of the
                        sixty-four squares alternate between light and dark, and are referred to as "light squares" and
                        "dark squares".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces: each player's pieces comprise one king, one
                        queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns. One player, referred to as White,
                        controls the white pieces and the other player, Black, controls the black pieces; White is
                        always the first player to move. The players alternate moving one piece at a time. Pieces are
                        moved to either an unoccupied square, or one occupied by an opponent's piece, capturing it and
                        removing it from play. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the
                        opponent's king is in check, and there are no moves that remove the king from attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The king can move only one square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The rook moves any
                        number of vacant squares vertically or horizontally. The bishop moves any number of vacant
                        squares in any direction diagonally. The queen can move any number of vacant squares diagonally,
                        horizontally, or vertically. The knight can jump over occupied squares and moves two spaces
                        horizontally and one space vertically or vice versa, making an "L" shape. A pawn can move
                        forward one square, if that square is unoccupied. If it has not moved yet, the pawn has the
                        option of moving two squares forward, if both squares in front of the pawn are unoccupied. A
                        pawn cannot move backward. They can capture an enemy piece on either of the two spaces adjacent
                        to the space in front of them. If a pawn advances all the way to its eighth rank, it is then
                        promoted (converted) to a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color.

                    <p>
                        In chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be
                        calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer. The possible depth of calculation
                        depends on the player's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a
                        deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in "tactical" positions with
                        a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers; for example,
                        pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks, zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys,
                        sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.

                        Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and
                        long-term plans for the future play. During the evaluation, players must take into account
                        numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and
                        centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of
                        squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).

                        A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the "opening moves"). Recognized
                        sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy
                        Lopez or Sicilian Defense.

                    <p>
                        The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line
                        between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces
                        have been developed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the
                        position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position.

                    <p>
                        The endgame is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are
                        three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Pawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by
                            advancing it to the furthest rank.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The king, which required safeguarding from checkmate in the middlegame, emerges as a strong
                            piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect
                            its own pawns, attack enemy pawns, and hinder moves of the opponent's king.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zugzwang, disadvantageous since it forces a player to move, is often a factor in endgames
                            but rarely in other stages of the game.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
